* we should make a test to verify that we're describing all of our
policies somewhere the Perl::Critic distribution uses PolicySummary.pm
and t/80_policysummary.t to ensure this. If we continue to document
ours in Bangs.pm, we should copy and modify their test script.

* Not all of our policies pass perlcritic yet.

* several of our test methods are stolen directly from the
Perl::Critic distribution. We should come up with a common way to
indicate this to help us keep them updated when they change the
originals.

* Is it really necessary to make top-level symlinks to all of our
policies now?

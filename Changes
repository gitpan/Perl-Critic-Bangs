Revision history for Perl-Critic-Bangs

1.00    Mon May 26 19:10:40 CDT 2008

    Updated to work with modern Perl::Critic 1.084.  Thanks to
    Elliot Shank for making that happen.

    [FIXES]
    Fixed bug in ProhibitCommentedOutCode which prevented custom
    configuration from working.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added utf8 to the list of exceptions in ProhibitNumberedNames.
    The exceptions are also now case-insensitive.

    Added ProhibitUselessRegexModifiers.pm policy switched to testing
    method that Perl::Critic uses.
